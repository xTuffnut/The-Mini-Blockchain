# The-Mini-Blockchain
🔗 Mini Blockchain in Python

    A simple yet fully functional blockchain implementation in Python that demonstrates core blockchain concepts, including hashing, mining, Proof of Work, and chain validation.

🎯 Overview

    This project is an educational implementation of a blockchain system built from scratch using only Python's built-in libraries. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts that power cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, including:

        Block Structure: How blocks store and organize data
    Cryptographic Hashing: Using SHA-256 for data integrity
    Proof of Work: The mining process that secures the blockchain
    Chain Validation: Detecting tampering and ensuring chain integrity
    Immutability: Why blockchain data cannot be changed once written

    Perfect for:

        🎓 Learning blockchain fundamentals
        👨‍💻 Understanding how cryptocurrencies work
        📚 Educational projects and assignments
        🔬 Experimenting with blockchain concepts

    ✨ Features

        ✅ Pure Python - No external dependencies required
        ✅ Complete Block Structure - Index, timestamp, data, previous hash, nonce, and hash
        ✅ SHA-256 Hashing - Industry-standard cryptographic hashing
        ✅ Proof of Work Mining - Adjustable difficulty with real-time statistics
        ✅ Chain Validation - Three-level verification system
        ✅ Tamper Detection - Immediate detection of any modifications
        ✅ Genesis Block - Proper initialization of the blockchain
        ✅ Visual Output - Beautifully formatted console display
        ✅ Mining Statistics - Track nonce, attempts, and mining time

🚀 Installation
        Prerequisites

            Python 3.6 or higher
            No external libraries needed! (Uses only built-in hashlib, time, datetime)

1. Setup

    Clone the repository

        git clone https://github.com/xTuffnut/mini-blockchain.git
        cd mini-blockchain

2. That's it! No dependencies to install.

💻 Usage
    Basic Usage

    Run the blockchain demonstration:

    python blockchain.py

🎓 Educational Purpose

    This project is designed for learning. It demonstrates:
What It Teaches

        ✅ How blockchains link blocks together
        ✅ Why changing old data is detected
        ✅ How Proof of Work secures the network
        ✅ Why blockchain is called "immutable"
        ✅ The basics of cryptocurrency technology

    What It Simplifies

        ❌ No network/P2P communication
        ❌ No real transactions with signatures
        ❌ No consensus between multiple nodes
        ❌ No transaction pools (mempool)
        ❌ No wallet system
